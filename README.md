# sop find

  2 week school project in the subject Virtualization and cloud technologies.
  Requirements are that it uses docker-compose, SQL and some messaging service. I decided to use kafka as a messaging service and MySQL. The service is programmed in Python. The API is also in Python.
  It's purpose is to give teachers the needed data about students with special educational needs. (СОП in bulgarian)
  Currently it has only one feature - for a given teacher it returns every student with sop that teacher has classes with.
